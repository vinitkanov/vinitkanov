# Vinitka Yeshynovka ðŸŽ€

Iâ€™m a junior developer with hands-on experience in full-stack web development. My primary focus has been on building and maintaining websites using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React on the front end, complemented by Python and MySQL on the back end.

Much of my time is spent debugging, compiling, and refining codeâ€”ensuring both functionality and performance. I'm deeply committed to improving my development workflow and continuously expanding my skill set. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into C++ to strengthen my understanding of low-level programming and broaden my software development capabilities.
